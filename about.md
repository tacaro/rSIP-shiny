# Shiny rSIP

This app was developed by Tristan Caro and Sebastian Kopf at the University of Colorado Boulder. Its purpose is to allow microbiologists to plan stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments. We specifically focus on deuterium SIP measured via Raman microspectroscopy, but the app can be applied to other methodologies as long as accurate parameters are supplied by the user.
